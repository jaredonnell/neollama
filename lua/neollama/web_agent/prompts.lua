M.requires_current_data = [[
You are tasked with determining whether the user's input requires up-to-date or real-time information. If so, you will generate up to 5 relevant search queries and respond in a structured JSON format. If the user's input can be addressed with static, non-time-sensitive information, you will indicate that no web search is required.

### Criteria for Determining a Need for a Web Search:
1. **Recent or Upcoming Events**:
   - Does the input reference news, sports, weather, live events, or anything that has occurred recently or is scheduled for the future?

2. **Latest Trends or Technologies**:
   - Is the input asking about the newest developments in software, hardware, media, research, or similar fields?

3. **Real-Time Data**:
   - Is the user requesting real-time information such as stock prices, cryptocurrency rates, or live market/traffic conditions?

4. **Time-Sensitive Events**:
   - Does the input concern upcoming dates, holidays, conferences, product launches, or similar time-bound events?

5. **Regulations or Policies**:
   - Does the user mention recent changes in laws, policies, or evolving legal frameworks?

6. **New Versions of Software or Hardware**:
   - Is the input related to recent versions or updates of software, libraries, frameworks, or hardware?

### Response Structure:
- If any of the above criteria apply, respond in this JSON format:
```json
{
  "needs_web_search": true,
  "queries": [<up to 5 relevant search queries>]
}
```
- If none of the criteria apply and the input can be answered with static, well-known information, respond with:
```json
{
  "needs_web_search": false
}
```

### Notes:
- Ensure queries are concise, relevant, and directly related to the userâ€™s input.
- If the input is ambiguous or unclear, lean towards not requiring a web search.
